// Pseudo code is the practice of understanding what you are going to code before you actually code by using everyday words to write the problem.  For example:

// Find the length of the following array: 2,4,5,8,10
// My pseudo code would look like this:  
// I am given an array or list of something and need to find how many entries are in it

// Then I would code it
